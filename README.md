Welcome to Gomoku!<br>
<br>
This is a remake of the Japanese Gomoku game in C. You will play in 1 versus 1 on a 19x19 grid.<br>
Long story short, the game is about making a line of five pieces either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.<br>
Additional rules are applied, you may try "./gomoku --help" to know more about the rules and available options.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>
